1.  Forest Fire Prevention using IBM Cloud

We have chosen the idea to provide natural disaster preparedness.  With these events growing in frequency, cloud sourcing technology is the best bet to develop better ways of evolving our response.

Our application would determine the best methods for prevention and alert, and aid first-responders in evacuation and firefighting operations. 
We have planned to train our system using machine learning prediction algorithm, whenever any disaster about to happen in certain area, we will train our system to predict it and henceforth first -aid can be provided. We are also providing online assistance using IBM Watson, to the people who have been caught into such situations and can follow our guideline to rescue. This will be the android app with IBM Watson integrated with machine learning and IBM cloud.


2. Voice based email for visually challenged people  - APPROVED
comment: integrate with google home 

This project aims to help the visually impaired people to be a part of growing world by using internet and also aims to make life of such people quite easy. 
We are planning to make the application for them where use of the keyboard completely eliminated, and the user will have to respond through voice and mouse click only. It will take the user actions based on the click whether its left click or right click. We will provide the option like if user left click, can compose the mail or if right click can send the mails, double click goes to inbox.
We will be using IBM Watson speech to text and simple web application to achieve this.
